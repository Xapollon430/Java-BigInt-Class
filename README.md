# Java-BigInt-Class
Java has a primite integer type which only goes up to 2^32 which is a 10 digit number, small right? This BigInt solves that very problem by using OOP and Data Structures pillars.
This is one of the school projects I did that covers how to break down big problems into small solving algorithms and build up a very long and complex solution to the BigInt problem.
